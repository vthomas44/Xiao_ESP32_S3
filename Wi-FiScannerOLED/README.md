# Wi-Fi Scanner for Seeed XIAO ESP32-S3 with OLED Display

## Overview
This project is a simple Wi-Fi scanner program designed for the Seeed XIAO ESP32-S3 microcontroller with a 0.96-inch 128x64 OLED display. It scans for nearby Wi-Fi networks and displays their details, including signal strength and quality, directly on the OLED screen.

## Features
- **Scans and lists up to 5 nearby Wi-Fi networks**
- **Displays SSID , Signal Strength and Signal Quality**

## Hardware Requirements
1. Seeed XIAO ESP32-S3 microcontroller.
2. 0.96-inch OLED Display with I2C interface (128x64 resolution).
3. Connection wires for I2C communication (SDA Pin to GPIO 5 and SCL Pin to GPIO 6).

## Libraries
1. Adafruit SSD1306
2. Adafruit GFX Library
3. Built-in Wire and WiFi libraries.
